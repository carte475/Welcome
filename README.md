# Hello there!

I hope you are enjoying your visit on my GitHub page.  
I am quite confused about how this all works.  
In time, you might notice some improvements around here--or so I hope.   

## Why Open Science Matters

Google Scholar says,  
>"Stand on the shoulders of giants." 

But what are _the shoulders_, where did they come from, and how were they built?  

These are some of the questions that drive my passion for Open Science. In an effort to make these areas of inquiry more transparent in my own research, I have created a GitHub account. This will host  all my available code and data (when permitted). It is a work in progress, so please be patient!
