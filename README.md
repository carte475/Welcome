# Hello there!

I hope you are enjoying your visit on my GitHub page.  
I am quite confused about how this all works.  
In time, you might notice some improvements around here--or so I hope.   

## Why Open Science Matters

[Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/) says,  
>"Stand on the shoulders of giants." 

But what are the shoulders? Where did they come from? How were they built?  

These are some of the questions that continue to drive my vested interest in Open Science. In an effort to make these gaps of knowledge more transparent in my own research, I have created a GitHub account. This will host  all my available code and data (when permitted). It is a work in progress, so please be patient!
