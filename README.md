# Hello there!

I hope you are enjoying your visit on my GitHub page.  
I am quite confused about how this all works.  
In time, you might notice some improvements aroudn here--or so I hope.   

## Why Open Science Matters

Science is built on the shoulders of giants. We never really think about what those shoulders are, where they come from, or how they are built.  
In an effort to make these areas of inquiry more transparent in my own research, I have created a GitHub account. This will host  all my available code and data (when permitted). It is a work in progress, so please be patient!
